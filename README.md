CONTEXTUAL COMPRESSION. A prompt that somehow condenses the responses context back into the initial prompt.
This will eliminate message history and there will always be one message intstead list of messages.




Contextual Compression Techniques

  Phonetic Spelling System 
    "convert the prompt to a phonetic spelling system that is less characters than original prompt"
  
  Translation
    "translate the prompt to language with least character response"

  Encoding
    "use <compressionalgorithm> and output the encodings with cypher"

  Referencing
    Find books that mention the phrase "Good Day".
    Respond in this format:
    <Book> <page> <begin element position> <end element position>
    
  Post Rendering Prompt / Question
    "here is the prompt <prompt> do not render the prompts response but keep output on standby"
    
  Writing Age
    start loop (age < 30)
       write this prompt the way a <age> would: <prompt>
    end loop
    if an age group used a coherent response compared to the original prompt and is shorter then use it.
    
  Writing Style
  
  OppositeA <-> OppossiteB 
  
    Convert oppositable words in prompt: <prompt>.
    If opposite prompt shorter than original prompt save it.
    
  Same meaning ask different way
        start loop (count < 30)
          write this prompt a different way with same meaning: <prompt>
        end loop
        if any of the prompts is shorter than the original prompt then replace original with new
